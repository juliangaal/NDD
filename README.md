## NDD

The code for our paper accepted by  **IROS 2022** (NDD:A Normal Distribution Based 3D Point Cloud Descriptor for Loop Closure Detection)


We present a global descriptor, named Normal Distribution Descriptor (NDD), for 3D point cloud loop closure detection. The descriptor encodes both the probability density score and entropy of a point cloud as the descriptor. We also propose a fast rotation alignment process and use correlation coefficient as the similarity between descriptors.
